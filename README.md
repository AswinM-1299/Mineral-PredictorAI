## Key Features of the Code

### ðŸ”¹ Data Processing
- Reads geochemical and spatial datasets
- Reprojects all layers to a common CRS (WGS84)
- Samples raster values from aeromagnetic and gravity rasters
- Calculates distances to nearby faults, folds, and other geological features
- Generates a synthetic depth estimate using magnetic intensity

### ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering
- Builds a 22-feature matrix combining:
  - 13 geochemical features (element ppm/ppb)
  - 6 structural/spatial distances
  - 2 geophysical raster values
  - 1 synthetic depth feature

### ðŸ”¹ Mineral Labeling
- Assigns one of 13 mineral classes based on geochemical thresholds (Ce, La, Nd, Cu, Au, U, Th, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Li, Cr)

### ðŸ”¹ Model Training
- Applies `BorderlineSMOTE` for class balancing (k_neighbors=2)
- Trains both `MLPClassifier` and `RandomForestClassifier`
- Selects the best model based on macro ROC-AUC

### ðŸ”¹ Evaluation
- Computes confusion matrix, classification report, macro F1-score
- Generates multi-class ROC curves
- Plots Random Forest feature importances (for interpretability)

### ðŸ”¹ Output Generation
- Saves trained model (`.pth`), scaler (`.pkl`), and predictions (`.geojson`)
- Creates:
  - Interactive 2D prediction map (`.html` with Folium)
  - Mineral-wise abundance maps (`Ce_abundance_map.html`, etc.)
  - 3D terrain map with mineral predictions + lineaments (`enhanced_3d_map.html`)

### ðŸ”¹ Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
pip install geopandas rasterio scikit-learn torch torchvision shapely matplotlib folium branca imbalanced-learn plotly
